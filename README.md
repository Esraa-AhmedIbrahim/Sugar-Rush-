Description:

Sugar Rush is a 2D candy-themed maze game where the player collects keys while avoiding enemies and traps to ultimately unlock and reach the Super Candy, ending the level. 
Players navigate the maze using keyboard controls (WASD), picking up keys and optional coins while dodging patrolling bees and spike traps. Movement through the maze involves both exploration and timing, 
with automatic key collection and dynamic gate unlocking once objectives are met.
The game emphasizes skillful navigation, reaction time, and strategic planning. Hazards such as algorithm-driven bees (A* pathfinding and constant-path types) and 
animated traps create varying levels of challenge.Failure to avoid these threats results in level resets, reinforcing careful gameplay and attention
Sugar Rush creatively merges traditional maze-solving with modern AI techniques taught in academic settings.
Its unique use of multiple AI enemy behaviors and animated environmental hazards adds depth to the gameplay,
delivering a puzzle-action experience in a colorful, whimsical setting without relying on emotional storytelling.
